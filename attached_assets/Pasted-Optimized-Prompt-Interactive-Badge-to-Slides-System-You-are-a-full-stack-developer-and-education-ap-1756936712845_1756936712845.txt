Badge icons for quick recognition.
Casual, Gen Z tone (e.g., “Drop your evidence here ✨”).
Keep the reflection prompts short and easy to answer.
Slides should be clean, simple, and consistent (title + image + text per slide).

Include sample slide export.
Show example flow using one badge (e.g., Innovation 2 with 3 evidence items).
